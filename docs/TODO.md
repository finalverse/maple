# TODO: Making MAPLE the Best AI Agent Framework

- [ ] **Implement gRPC support in UAL** – complete encoding/decoding for efficient binary communication.
- [ ] **Finish message routing in MAP** – send and receive peer messages rather than printing to stdout.
- [ ] **Persistent storage for MRS** – use MapleDB or PostgreSQL to store registered agents and DIDs.
- [ ] **Real LLM integrations** – connect `maple-llm` to engines like Llama.cpp or Mistral for generation.
- [ ] **DID resolution service** – map DIDs to peer IDs and network addresses.
- [ ] **Vector database backend** – plug `maple-vectordb` into Qdrant/Milvus for similarity search.
- [ ] **Runtime enhancements** – scaling across clusters, authorization, and graceful shutdown.
- [ ] **Extensive tests and benchmarks** – ensure reliability and measure performance across crates.
- [ ] **Documentation website** – publish the content of `docs/` with examples and tutorials.
- [ ] **Community contributions** – gather feedback and accept external agents or plugins.
